# if this is a subsequent SSH into the device you might get met with the following error:
# @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
# @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
# @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
# IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
# Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
# It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
# The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
# SHA256:sUUckwGBFH3Xp3zk+gPFgCtHVdgrePmEGnrguvA6BZM.
# Please contact your system administrator.
# Add correct host key in /Users/xxxxxxxxxx/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
# Offending ECDSA key in /Users/xxxxxxxxxx/.ssh/known_hosts:13
# ECDSA host key for xx.xx.xx.xx has changed and you have requested strict checking.
# Host key verification failed.

# run this command to clear that error:
ssh-keygen -R {device IP address}

# now reconnect
ssh pi@{device IP address}
# enter password. Hardware default is 'raspberry'.

# if you continue to get errors like 'connection refused', you need to start the SSH server on Pi.

# to share files between your host device and the Pi via CLI, I did the following in MacOS:
# if you don't already have brew, here it is:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# then install OSXFuse and SSHfs
brew cask install osxfuse
brew install sshfs
